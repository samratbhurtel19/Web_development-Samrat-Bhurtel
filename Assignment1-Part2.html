    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Ontario offers some of the finest bird watching experiences in Canada. 
        There are almost 500 species of birds to spot and close to 300 species that breed in the province.</p>

        <p>In terms of numbers and variety, peak birding is the spring and fall. During these seasons, migrating songbirds, 
        shorebirds, waterfowl and birds of prey select sites for temporary pit stops on route to and from 
        their nesting destinations. However, bird watching in Ontario is a four-season activity thanks to 
        the bird species that reside in the province year-round.</p>
        
        <h2>Favourite Photos</h2>

        <p>Rondeau Provincial Park, Ontarioâ€™s second oldest provincial park, is a world renowned bird watch destination.</p>
